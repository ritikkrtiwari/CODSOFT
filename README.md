# CODSOFT
# CodSoft Internship Projects (C++)

This repository contains 5 simple console-based projects I built as part of my **CodSoft internship**.  
Each project is written in C++ and focuses on practicing core programming concepts.

## ✅ **TASK 1 – Calculator**
A basic calculator that:
- Lets the user enter two numbers
- Choose an operation: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Displays the result
- Handles division by zero

> 🔧 Tech: C++, user input, if-else conditions

---

## 🎲 **TASK 2 – Number Guessing Game**
A simple console game where:
- The program has a secret number (fixed or random)
- User keeps guessing until they find the correct number
- Shows hints: “Too high” or “Too low”

> 🔧 Tech: C++, loops, conditionals, random numbers

---

## ❌⭕ **TASK 3 – Tic-Tac-Toe**
Two-player console game:
- 3×3 game board
- Players take turns as `X` and `O`
- Checks for win or draw after each move
- Option to play again

> 🔧 Tech: C++, arrays, loops, functions

---

## 📝 **TASK 4 – To-Do List**
A console-based to-do list manager:
- Add new tasks
- View all tasks (with status: pending or done)
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks from the list

> 🔧 Tech: C++, vectors, structs, loops

---

## 🖼️ **TASK 5 – Image Processing Tool**
A simple console tool using OpenCV that can:
- Load and display an image
- Apply filters (grayscale, blur, sharpen)
- Adjust brightness and contrast
- Crop and resize the image
- Save the edited image

> 🔧 Tech: C++ and OpenCV library

---

## ✏ **Purpose of these projects**
These small projects helped me practice:
- Basic C++ concepts: loops, conditionals, arrays, vectors, functions
- Handling user input and console output
- Simple image processing using OpenCV

All code is written in a beginner-friendly style so it’s easy to read and understand.

## 🚀 **How to run**
For each project:
```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
